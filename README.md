# NUS DAC 2022 Team-UpIsTheOnlyWay Data Analysis

This repository contains the code for data analysis using Grab's GPS trajectory dataset by Team UpIsTheOnlyWay.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is Grab's GPS trajectory dataset. It contains the GPS locations and timestamps of Grab vehicles in Southeast Asia. The dataset was preprocessed to remove erroneous data and converted into CSV format.
Packages Used

The following packages were used for the data analysis:

    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Geopandas
    Dask
    Seaborn
    Folium

## Analysis

The analysis of the dataset was done using Python 3. The code for the analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook file Data Analysis.ipynb.

The analysis includes:

    Loading the dataset
    Data cleaning and preprocessing
    Visualizing the data using plots and maps
    Extracting insights and trends from the data

## Results

The analysis of the dataset revealed interesting insights and trends about the traffic patterns in Southeast Asia. The results are summarized in the Jupyter notebook file Data Analysis.ipynb.
## Installation and Usage

To run the code, you must have Python 3 and the required packages installed. Clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebook to run the code. <br>

Note: The uploaded Jupyter files are too big to be displayed in Github due to the large size of the dataset and the subsequent data analysis and computations.
